Turn a poem into a visualization

- break text into syllables
- obtain phoneme representation of syllables
- now we define a distance metric between syllables based on their phonemes
- text is tokenized into syllables; these should be converted to coordinates: 
	- vowel, leading consonant, trailing consonant?
	- gives a triple, which can be used to determine color
- step 1: break text into colors
- turn syllables into polygons?
- 3D spiral with each syllable a 3D shape?
